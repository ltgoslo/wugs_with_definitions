# Word Usage Graphs enriched with cluster definitions
This is a dataset of word usage graphs (WUGs), where the existing WUGs for multiple languages are enriched with cluster labels functioning as sense definitions. 
They are generated from scratch by fine-tuned encoder-decoder language models. 

We hope that the resulting enriched datasets can be helpful for moving on to explainable semantic change modeling.
