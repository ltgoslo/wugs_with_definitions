cluster	gloss
-1	a machine tool with a separate, upright stand; an electric drill is pressed into the work automatically or with a hand lever / a simple machine of the inclined-plane type consisting of a spirally threaded cylindrical rod that engages with a similarly threaded hole / a single-reed instrument with a straight tube
0	a commercial airplane that carries passengers
1	a function of a topological space that gives, for any two points in the space, a value equal to the distance between them
2	a function of a topological space that gives, for any two points in the space, a value equal to the distance between them
3	a function of a topological space that gives, for any two points in the space, a value equal to the distance between them
4	an edge tool with a flat steel blade with a cutting edge
5	a coordinate system for which the coordinates of a point are its distances from a set perpendicular lines that intersect at the origin of the system
6	(geometry) a plane rectangle with four equal sides and four right angles; a four-sided regular polygon / a common scrubby deciduous tree of central and southeastern United States having dark bark and broad three-lobed (club-shaped) leaves; tends to form dense thickets / a coordinate system for which the coordinates of a point are its distances from a set perpendicular lines that intersect at the origin of the system / a function of a topological space that gives, for any two points in the space, a value equal to the distance between them / a horizontal branch from the base of plant that produces new plants from buds at its tips / a mountain peak in southeastern Alaska that is part of the Coast Range (14,950 feet high) / a ridge of the earth's crust that has been forced upward between two faults and so is higher than the surrounding land / a trigonometric method of determining the position of a fixed point from the angles to it from two fixed points a known distance apart; useful in navigation / having a surface without slope, tilt in which no part is higher or lower than another / large symmetrical deciduous tree with rounded crown widely distributed in eastern North America; has large leaves with triangular spiny tipped lobes and coarse-grained wood less durable than that of white oaks / medium-large deciduous tree with a thick trunk found in the eastern United States and southern Canada and having close-grained wood and deeply seven-lobed leaves turning scarlet in autumn / two surfaces meeting at an angle different from 90 degrees
7	a function of a topological space that gives, for any two points in the space, a value equal to the distance between them / being everywhere equidistant and not intersecting / of or relating to spatial distribution
8	a function of a topological space that gives, for any two points in the space, a value equal to the distance between them / a straight line or plane that touches a curve or curved surface at a point but does not intersect it at that point / the space between two lines or planes that intersect; the inclination of one line to another; measured in degrees or radians
