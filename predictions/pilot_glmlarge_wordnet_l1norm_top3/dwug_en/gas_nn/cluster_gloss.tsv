2	a colorless odorless gaseous element that give a red glow in a vacuum tube; one of the six inert gasses; occurs in the air in small amounts / a colorless poisonous gas; made by the oxidation of methanol / a colorless toxic gas with a pungent almond odor; has been used in chemical warfare / a volatile flammable mixture of hydrocarbons (hexane and heptane and octane etc.) derived from petroleum; used mainly as a fuel in internal-combustion engines / any isomeric saturated hydrocarbon found in petroleum and used as a fuel and solvent / the univalent hydrocarbon radical C2H5 derived from ethane by the removal of one hydrogen atom
3	(physical chemistry) a distinct state of matter in a system; matter that is identical in chemical composition and physical state and separated from other material by the phase boundary / (physical chemistry) a sample of matter in which substances in different phases are in equilibrium / (physics and chemistry) the smallest component of an element having the chemical properties of the element
4	a compound formed by solvation (the combination of solvent molecules with molecules or ions of the solute) / of or relating to a solution whose dilution has been reduced / the dissolved matter in a solution; the component of a solution that changes its state
5	converted into a gas or vapor / hydrocarbon gases, usually propane or butane, kept under pressure / the univalent hydrocarbon radical C2H5 derived from ethane by the removal of one hydrogen atom
6	a colorless fuming corrosive liquid; a powerful reducing agent; used chiefly in rocket fuels / a colorless toxic gas with a pungent almond odor; has been used in chemical warfare / a toxic mixture of gases (including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and nitrogen) after an explosion of firedamp in a mine
7	a mercantile establishment for the retail sale of goods or services / a public utility that provides gas / a service station that sells gasoline
8	a highly fissionable isotope of plutonium that is used in atomic weapons and as a reactor fuel; produced by irradiating uranium 238 with slow electrons / a waxy mineral that is a mixture of hydrocarbons and occurs in association with petroleum; some varieties are used in making ceresin and candles / any compound obtained from petroleum or natural gas
9	(cosmology) a hypothetical one-dimensional subatomic particle having a concentration of energy and the dynamic properties of a flexible loop / (physics) a particle that is less complex than an atom; regarded as constituents of all matter / the natural satellite of the Earth
